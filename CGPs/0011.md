- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This proposal sets the gasLimit parameter of the Celoblockchain to 13M from 10M. This change is necessary to accomodate the contract deploy of Celo core smart contracts whose size has increased since the initial deploy.

## Proposed Changes

1. Increase the gasLimit
  - Destination: A human readable description of the address and method being called
  - Data: A human readable description of the transaction data
  - Value: How much cGLD is being sent, and why?

## Testing

To check and validate the performance of the networks under high pressure of gas consumption, a celo testnet was deployed with the next parameters:

- Running validators: 100
- Elected validators: 100
- Proxied validators: 75
- Block time: 5 seconds
- Epoch: Each 500 blocks
- Celo-blockchain version: 1.0.1
- Celo-monorepo (protocol) version: a049b200c7a7972463f2d088ec274d0fd1a4b32d
- Validator resources: CPU = 4 cores; Memory = 10Gbi
- Proxy resources: CPU = 4 cores; Memory = 10Gbi

The load transactions were generated as token transfers, transfering different tokens and also using different currencies for paying the transaction fees.

With a block gas limit of 17M and a equal constant load of 17M, the testnet was running for 6 hours and 45, with a average block time of 6.48 seconds, and a . There were not any major stall of the network and the only issue observer was some epoch block duration of around 2 minutes.

After reducing the block gas limit to 13M and a constant block gas consumption very close to 13M, the testnet was running for 10 hours, with not major issue observed, and avarage block time of 5.6 seconds and most of the epoch block duration around 2 minutes. We can explain the deviation from the 5 seconds block time due to the block duration for epoch and epoch+1 blocks.

In the view of the results obtainer after the testing, we can reach the conclusion that the network can handle an increament an increament on the gas block limit to 13M without notoriously impacting the average block time.

## Verification

An explanation of how voters can verify that this CGP does what it intends to do. Can be left as “TODO” until the proposal is made. Include things like CLI commands to run and pointers to code.

## Risks

Highlight any risks and concerns that may affect consensus, proof-of-stake, governance, protocol economics, the stability protocol, security, and privacy.
