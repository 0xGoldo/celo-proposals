## Overview

This proposal will extend the expiration of a requested attestation from 1 HOUR -> 1 DAY, improving upon [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0015.md) which previously attempted to do so.

The initial [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0015.md) attempted to extend the expiration time of attestations from 1 hour to 24 hours by changing attestationExpiryBlocks in the Attestation contract. However, the Random contract only retains randomness for a period of blocks specified by randomnessBlockRetentionWindow. Though the Attestation contract was updated to be able to query randomness between 1 and 24 hours, the Random contract remains unable to serve those requests. Therefore, the expiration time for attestations remains functionally 1 hour.

See [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0015.md) for further context on the motivation for extending the expiration of requested attestations. 

## Proposed Changes

1. Set Random randomnessBlockRetentionWindow to 60 * 60 * 24 / 5 (24 hours with 5 seconds per block)
  - Destination: randomnessBlockRetentionWindow [setRandomnessBlockRetentionWindow](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/fb4f828a4e001b73a8c39aa34e3395f4015aaabc/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Random.sol#L59)
  - Data: 17280
  - Value: 0

## Verification

- Call Random.sol `randomnessBlockRetentionWindow()` to see that the current parameter value is 720. After execution of this proposal, that value will be 24 times greater, 17280.

## Risks

See [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0015.md) for further context on the risks of extending the expiration of requested attestations.
