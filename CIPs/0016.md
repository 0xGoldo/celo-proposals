# CIP [0000]: Title for Improvement

- Date: 2020-07-27
- Author: @yorhodes
- Status: WIP

## Overview

Create a standard QR scheme for encoding interacting with the Celo protocol for various consumers including SDKs, mobile wallets, and end users.
Various QR schemes are used across implementations like Valora and ContractKit.
Facilitate development of QR systems by standardizing usage and unifying scheme for interoperability.

## Goals

- adapt [ERC 67](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/67), [EIP 681](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-681.md0), and [EIP 831](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-831.md) to the celo protocol
- establish URI standard compatible with mobile app intents that optimizes for **memory** and **performance**
- enable simple construction of URIs by humans with celo protocol understanding
- enable simple construction of QRs by code from arbitrary celo transactions

## Proposed Solution

### Syntax
Celo protocol URLs contain "celo" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "celo:" scheme [ "?" parameters ]
    scheme                  = ("pay-" pay_scheme) / ("tx-" tx_scheme)
    
    pay_scheme              = target [ "/" token ]
    token                   = "cUSD" / "CELO" / ...
    
    tx_scheme               = target [ "/" function_name "(" function_args ")" ]
    function_name           = STRING
    function_args           = function_arg *( "," function_arg )
    function_arg            = ( NUMBER / STRING ) [ ":" TYPE ]
    
    target                  = E164_PHONE_NUMBER / registry_id / celo_address
    registry_id             = "StableToken" / "GoldToken" / "LockedGold" / ...
    celo_address            = ( "0x" 40*40HEXDIG )

    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = "value" / "gas" / "gasPrice" / "feeCurrency" / "gatewayFee" / "gatewayFeeRecipient" / "localAmount" / "localCurrencyCode" / ...
    value                   = NUMBER / STRING / celo_address / registry_id

`TYPE` is a standard ABI type name, as defined in [Ethereum Contract ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html). `STRING` is a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

`E164_PHONE_NUMBER` is a standard E164 universal phone number, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union in [E164 Number Specification](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164).
