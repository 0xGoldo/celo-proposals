# CIP [0000]: Title for Improvement

- Date: 2020-07-27

- Status: WIP

## Overview

Create a standard QR scheme for encoding interacting with the Celo protocol for various consumers including SDKs, mobile wallets, and end users.
Various QR schemes are used across implementations like Valora and ContractKit.
Facilitate development of QR systems by standardizing usage and unifying scheme for interoperability.

## Goals

- establish URI standard compatible with mobile app intents that optimizes for **memory** and **performance**
- enable simple construction of URIs by humans without deep celo protocol understanding
- enable simple construction of QRs by code from arbitrary celo transactions

## Proposed Solution

### Syntax
Celo protocol URLs contain "celo" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "celo:" [ prefix "-" ] target [ "/" endpoint ] [ "?" parameters ]
    prefix                  = "pay" / "call"
    
    target                  = E164_PHONE_NUMBER / registry_id / celo_address
    registry_id             = "StableToken" / "GoldToken" / "LockedGold" / ...
    celo_address            = ( "0x" 40*40HEXDIG )
    
    endpoint                = token / function
    token                   = "cUSD" / "CELO" / ...
    function                = function_name "(" [ function_args ] ")"
    function_name           = STRING
    function_args           = function_arg *( "," function_arg )
    function_arg            = ( NUMBER / STRING ) [ ":" TYPE ]

    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = "value" / "gas" / "gasPrice" / "feeCurrency" / "gatewayFee" / "gatewayFeeRecipient" / "localAmount" / "localCurrencyCode" / ...
    value                   = NUMBER / STRING / target

`TYPE` is a standard ABI type name, as defined in [Ethereum Contract ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html). `STRING` is a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

`E164_PHONE_NUMBER` is a standard E164 universal phone number, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union in [E164 Number Specification](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164).

### Semantics

`prefix` is optionally used for differentiating between user and contract `target`s. `pay` is for user targets and is intended for use with phone numbers or addresses and the `token` endpoint. `call` is for contract targets and is intended for use with the registry or addresses and the `function` endpoint. 

`token` is provided as an endpoint to more concisely encode celo protocol-aware ERC20 transfers that would otherwise be represented via a `function` endpoint.

`localAmount` is intended for use with `localCurrencyCode` and specifies a value in a locale-specific denomination (to be eventually translated by the application to a celo-specific denomination). Resolving `value` with `localAmount` is discretionary.

`function_args` have an optional `TYPE` because, in some cases, the application may have knowledge of the ABIs deeming the solidity types unnecessary. These can most likely be omitted when used with a celo registry contract via a `registry_id` target.

###  Rationale

[WIP]

## Alternative Solutions

A more ethereum-like generalized approach would reduce spec complexity but fails to meet goals of 
1. memory/performance optimizations
2. human-readability

## Risks

- Confusion between extensive set of endpoint parameters.
- Ease of use for phone number targets.
- Deprecated registry IDs or phone number verifications.
