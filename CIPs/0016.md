# CIP [0016]: Universal celo protocol URI scheme for QRs/deep links

- Date: 2020-07-27
- Author: @yorhodes
- Status: WIP

## Overview

Create a standard URI scheme for encoding interacting with the Celo protocol for various consumers including SDKs, mobile wallets, and end users.
Facilitate development of QR systems by standardizing usage and unifying scheme for interoperability.

## Goals

- establish URI standard compatible with mobile app intents that optimizes for **memory** and **performance**
- enable simple construction of URIs by humans without deep Celo protocol understanding
- enable simple construction of QRs by code from arbitrary Celo transactions

## Proposed Solution

### Syntax
Celo protocol URLs contain "celo" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "celo:" [ prefix "-" ] target [ "/" endpoint ] [ "?" parameters ]
    prefix                  = "pay" / "request" / "call" / "send"
    
    target                  = E164_PHONE_NUMBER / registry_id / celo_address
    registry_id             = "StableToken" / "GoldToken" / "LockedGold" / ...
    celo_address            = ( "0x" 40*HEXDIG )
    
    endpoint                = token / function
    token                   = "cUSD" / "CELO" / ...
    function                = function_name "(" [ function_args ] ")"
    function_name           = STRING
    function_args           = function_arg *( "," function_arg )
    function_arg            = ( NUMBER / STRING ) [ ":" TYPE ]

    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = "value" / "gas" / "gasPrice" / "feeCurrency" / "gatewayFee" / "gatewayFeeRecipient" / "localAmount" / "localCurrencyCode" / ...
    value                   = NUMBER / STRING / celo_address

### Semantics

`TYPE` is a standard ABI type name, as defined in [Ethereum Contract ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html). `STRING` is a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

`E164_PHONE_NUMBER` is a standard E164 universal phone number, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union [E164 Number Specification](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164).

`prefix` is used for differentiating between user and contract `target`s and actions. `pay` and `request` are for user targets and intended for use with phone numbers or addresses and the `token` endpoint. `call` & `send` are for contract targets and intended for use with the registry/addresses and the `function` endpoint. 

`token` is provided as an endpoint to more concisely encode Celo protocol-aware ERC20 transfers that would otherwise be represented via a `function` endpoint.

`registry_id` is provided to simplify and shorten Celo protocol-aware contract interactions (to be eventually translated by the application to a registry-specified 40 byte address). 

`function_args` have an optional `TYPE` because, in some cases, the application may have knowledge of the ABIs deeming the solidity types unnecessary. These can most likely be omitted when used with a Celo registry contract via a `registry_id` target.

`localAmount` is intended for use with `localCurrencyCode` and specifies a value in a locale-specific denomination (to be eventually translated by the application to a Celo-specific denomination). Resolving `value` with `localAmount` is discretionary.

### Rationale

Various QR schemes are used across implementations such as Valora, ContractKit, and likely others.

Expanding the `target` spec to be inclusive of phone numbers and contract registry identifiers makes statically generated QR codes less likely to expire than if an address (which can be changed or compromised) is used. 

For low-end mobile devices, QR codes are primarily bottlenecked by pixel density and image quality (Reed-Solomon error-correction). This proposal optimizes for these parameters and enables short URIs which can be deep-linked to application functionality.

## Alternative Solutions

A more ethereum-like VM generalized approach would reduce spec complexity but fails to meet aforementioned goals.

## Risks

- Confusion between extensive set of endpoint parameters.
- Ease of use for phone number targets.
- Deprecated registry IDs or phone number verifications.
