# CIP [0017]: Integrate Plumo Proofs into the lightest sync protocol

## Overview

In order to continue supporting the dream of a seamless mobile sync experience, the lightest sync protocol must be extended to support PLUMO Zk-SNARKs which can quickly verify transitions from epoch X to epoch X + Y, where Y could be on the order of 10s-100s of epochs.

The prover/verifier for plumo proofs have already been implemented, and the exposed go interface is available [here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-go)

## Goals

- Support adding/storing proofs on full nodes
- Gossip these proofs to propogate them through the network
- Extend the `les` protocol such that the server will provide these proofs in place of headers (when appropriate), and the client will consume/verify proofs accordingly.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to add two new RPCs: 
`AddProof(proof []byte, proofId uint)`
and
`Proofs() ([][]byte)`. When an eventual "proving service" generates a new proof it will publish this proof to a full node that it is running, which will then propogate the proof throughout the network.

This `AddProof` function will store the proof in a new database `plumoproofdata`, keyed by a unique proof ID.

To propogate these proofs throughout the network, we also propose to extend the `eth` protocol with two new message types: 
```
PlumoProofMsg - Sends plumo proof(s) either in response to a `GetPlumoProofMsg` or after a successful RPC call to `AddProof`
GetPlumoProofMsg - Request plumo proof(s) from a peer
```
`GetPlumoProofMsg` will be implemented by having the requester send a set of proof IDs that they hold, and ask for any they are missing. This may be optimized using a bloom filter as well.

The `les` protocol must then also be extended via at least two messages:
```
GetEpoch - Sends the current highest epoch known to the sender. Server responds with the minimal set of proofs & headers to give the light client the fastest sync time.
Epochs - Receives a mix of header(s) and proof(s) from the server.
```

The `les` client must then be modified to send a `GetEpoch` message during `lightest` sync. This will likely replace the function `getEpochOrNormalHeaders` within `eth/downloader`.

Upon receiving the `Epoch` response message, the light client must then verify headers and proofs provided. Proofs will be verified via a call into `celo-bls-go`'s `verify` fn.

The verify function requires information on an epoch's validator set, so this will likely require some access changes (private -> public) and exposing more data structures to allow the validator set to be queried and modified upon proof verification.

## Alternative Solutions

`GetPlumoProofMsg` could also request *all* plumo proofs from the receiver, leaving the responsibility of filtering seen proofs with the caller. This is a simpler implementation, but is less scalable as we increase the amount of stored proofs. 

On the type of ID to use for proofs: an incrementing counter seems most "user-friendly" because of the ability to sense gaps, but could introduce some synchronization issues in the future.

Specific aspects of the `les` changes may have tradeoffs that I've yet to encounter, so any input and feedback on things to consider there would be helpful.

## Risks

Altering the `eth` protocol introduces some risk of introducing bugs.

Introducing bugs to mobile client syncing.
