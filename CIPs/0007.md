# CIP [0007]: Affordable Gas Downtime Slasher

- Date: 2020-05-05
- Author: @gastonponti (with a lot of feedback and ideas from @m-chrzan)
- Status: WIP

## Overview

This proposal contains a new DowntimeSlasher contract.

The actual DowntimeSlasher tries to verify that the validator signed at least a block in all the window that is required to be validated which it leads to running out of gas for big windows.

The main goal of this new contract is to generate a tool that would allow any user to slash a validator for every possible block windows without gas limitations. 

For the actual window of 1/2 epoch, the DowntimeSlasher won't finish with a "run out gas" exception. Without this new tool for slashing, there is no a possible way to penalize a validator for downtime.

## Goals

Make a new contract that:
- Allows the user to slash a validator if it was down for a specific consecutive block window
- The implementation works for every possible block window (required in the initialization)

## Proposed Solution

Create a new contract funtion that divides the downtime verification in valid slots.

The user that wants to slash a particular validator will have to call a function from the contract `S_n` times (`S_n` could be asked to the contract itself) to verify each slot.

Then the user must generate another contract call to verify that the validator to be slashed was down for every consecutive slot.

### Process

1) The user calls the contract to know how many slots are required (`S_n`) and how many blocks must have every slot (`B_n`)

2) The user requires to validate `S_n` slots
    - The user calls the contract for the slot validation `[StartBlockNumber + (i * B_n), StartBlockNumber + ((1 + i) * B_n) )` with `0 <= i < S_n`

3) The user calls the slash method with the `StartBlockNumber` (internally will verify that every slot validation was performed and succeded)

### Variation of the proposed solution

- Every user generates the validation slots for itself. The first user to gather all the validations and trigger the slashing, collects the reward

- The slots validated works for every user in the community. When a slashing is performed, every user that generated a validated slot that is used to demostrate the downtime, receives a portion of the reward 

## Alternative Solutions

### Validator's Uptime in the epoch

The Celo blockchain for reward purposes, calculates an uptime for each validator. The validator’s uptime for the epoch is the proportion of blocks in the epoch for which it is ‘up’: U = counter / (epoch_size - 11).

One possible approach, it's to slash the validators if they are not covering a certain umbral.

#### Pros

The uptime calculation it's part of the Celo protocol. This not only allow us to save gas from calculating a possible slashing, but also could let the same blockchain to perform the slashes. This would make a safer net, instead of requiring a so rigurous control of the users.

In the actual scenario, if no user is controling, no one get slashed.

#### Cons

The validator's uptime is calculated at the end of the epoch, that has two potential problems:

- The slashing for an specific validator will be performed in the next epoch. That allows a validator that is not performing well in the epoch X, to be reelected for the epoch X+1, because the tool used for that (the uptime) was added after the election was completed.

- The uptime is a relation that has meaning tied to an specific epoch as whole. It won't give you a detail information of what happened.

For example, if the community sets the lower umbral as 50% this two scenarios have the same uptime:
 * A Validator is down for 1/2 epoch consecutive, and then signs every block for the next 1/2 epoch
 * A Validator signs 1 every 2 packages

Another problem is the calculation between epoch for reelected validators.
Using the same umbral of the other example, if the validator has in the epoch X = 75% uptime, and in the epoch X+1 = 70% uptime, this two numbers could hide a more that a 1/2 epoch consecutive blocks downtime. This will happen if the 25% of the downtime in the X is at the ending of the epoch, and the other 30% of the downtime for the epoch X+1 is at the beginning. 

### Challenge the validator

This solutions consist in solving a challenge between a user and the validator. 

The user could claim that the validator has been down for an specific period of blocks. In which case, the validator has an specific amount of time to bring a proove where the blockchain could verify that the validator was up. For example 1 or N blocks that where signed by the validator.

#### Pros

From the blockchain perspective, a simple and easy way for validating the uptime.

#### Cons

- Will require that each validator controls and follows the challenges that it has open against.

- The chain could have a flood of challenges every epoch. To avoid indiscriminated challenges we could require from the user to place a bid, that the validator could win if it prooves its inocence. This way we could avoid non-checked downtime challenges, and the validator could have a good incentive to adopt this alternative solution.

### Why were discarded the other solutions?

The objective of this CIP is to fix a tool that today doesn't work properly. Changing the way to calculate in which situations could a validator get slashed, requires a deeper discussion that don't have to be rushed.

If we change the rules, with a tool broken, we are basically forcing a result, and it's not the purporse of this CIP.
The author highly recommend to take in count these other ways of slashing for the future, without the rush that need brings.

These other tools could be complementary to the actual (and working properly) one. Cover the different aspects of what we believe is a validator working as it should, it's the key to setting the standards of excellence that we seek.
