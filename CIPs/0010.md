# CIP 0010: General Account Signer Authorization

- Date: 2020-05-13
- Author: @nambrot @kphed @eko-mirhard
- Status: WIP

## Overview

The `Accounts.sol` smart contract houses a general account abstraction that currently services the following purposes:
- Acts as the canonical account for the Proof-of-Stake system (aka LockedGold account)
- Keeps track of authorized signer keys in the PoS system (validator, voter, and attestation signers)
- Stores basic profile information such as a name and mapping to `dataEncryptionKey` and `walletAddress`
- Entry into an account's off-chain metadata

Over the past months, it has become noticeable that especially the authorization of signer keys by the "account key" is a very useful method to authenticate the "account owner" without having to unnecessarily bring the "account key" online which is the most privileged, and thus most important to secure. Example of such cases have been:

- The signing of the off-chain metadata should ideally not happen with the account key. During the development of the `ReleaseGold` smart contract it has been found that smart contracts as accounts cannot sign metadata. As a workaround, verifying metadata has been adjusted to allow any authorized signer to sign the payload, which violates the intention behind having well scoped authorized signers in the first place.
- As part of PGPNP, accounts have to authenticate with the PGPNP service for rate-limiting purposes. To do that, the "account key" has to sign the request which also violates the intention of keeping keys that can move funds as cold as possible.
- For other applications such as Profile Picture/Names or more down-the-road applications such as messaging, specific encryption keys are going to be useful. Additionally, the `dataEncryptionKey` seems out of place, despite it being effectively also an authorized key (if not signer).

As applications are developed on Celo, it becomes evident that this mechanism of authorizing signers is useful beyond the PoS system and this CIP proposes standardization to facilitate this good practice.

## Goals

- Reduce the chance of funds loss on Celo
- Increase the ergonomics of key management on Celo
- Reduce signer authorization overhead (i.e. remove development efforts related to PoP generation, and provide a friendlier experience for users)
- Enable smart contracts to be authorized as signers

## Proposed Solution

A new signer authorization implementation that makes use of state-transitioning method calls (as opposed to signature generation) as a means of confirming mutual consent between a Celo account and a signer address. In addition to being a lightweight* alternative for signer authorization, the proposed solution will also enable the authorization of smart contracts as signers, which are unable to generate the possession proofs that are currently required (due to their lack of private keys).

*Signer authorization in the proposed method will consist of only two transactions.

The proposed solution consists of two phases (each executed via method calls): initiation and completion.
- The "initiation" phase is carried out by a Celo account and creates a partial (i.e. pending) authorization by associating the account with the address of a signer and its type.
- The "completion" phase is carried out by a signer by “approving” an associated partial authorization and finalizing its assignment as a signer for an account.

### Changes

Streamline the signer-related logic within the `Accounts` contract and extend its utility to cover smart contract signer authorization with the following actions:
- Consolidate the following methods with their generic equivalents: (e.g. `XSignerToAccount` - where X is the signer type - replaced with `signerToAccountByType`**)
     - `authorizeXSigner`
     - `removeXSigner`
     - `getXSigner`
     - `removeXSigner`
     - `XSignerToAccount`
     - `hasAuthorizedXSigner`
- Implement a means for authorizing signers via method calls, as opposed to signatures, to enable the usage of smart contracts as signers.
- Update the account signer store to accommodate partial signer authorizations (utilized by the new signer authorization implementation as means of proving mutual consent).

**The `signerToAccountByType` method will be created, as opposed to updating the existing `signerToAccount` method, in order to minimize the number of changes to other contracts.

Update the following contracts by replacing the existing methods (listed below each contract) with their appropriate equivalent from the proposed solution:
- ReleaseGold
    - authorizeVoteSigner
    - authorizeValidatorSigner
    - authorizeValidatorSignerWithPublicKey
    - authorizeValidatorSignerWithKeys
    - authorizeAttestationSigner
    - getVoteSigner
    - getValidatorSigner
- Attestations
    - attestationSignerToAccount
    - hasAuthorizedAttestationSigner
- Validators
    - validatorSignerToAccount
    - getValidatorSigner
- Election
    - voteSignerToAccount
- Governance
    - voteSignerToAccount

### Execution

To minimize the chances of uncaught bugs or mistakes, the proposed solution will be fully implemented over a series of steps:
1. Implement the new signer authorization procedure as a complement to the existing one. Changes will only be made to the Accounts contract.
2. Update the signer-related methods called by other contracts in a manner that ensures a high level of operability confidence (e.g. updating, testing, and deploying contracts piecemeal, as opposed to all at once).
3. Remove the deprecated (now unused) signer authorization logic from the `Accounts` contract.

Proposed

## Alternative Solutions

Alternately, applications could always derive their own authorization scheme/smart contracts. However, it would not benefit from the tooling that could be possible for facilitating key management.

Instead of extending the `Signers` struct, a completely different smart contract `AuthorizedSigners` could be created. Functionality would be practically duplicated, but separated from the critical PoS system while gaining the benefit from a standardized authorization scheme.

## Risks

Upgrading core smart contracts + RG contracts.
