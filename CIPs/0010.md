# CIP 0010: General Account Signer Authorization

- Date: 2020-05-13
- Author: @nambrot
- Status: WIP

## Overview

The `Accounts.sol` smart contract houses a general account abstraction that currently services the following purposes:
- Acts as the canonical account for the Proof-of-Stake system (aka LockedGold account)
- Keeps track of authorized signer keys in the PoS system (validator, voter, and attestation signers)
- Stores basic profile information such as a name and mapping to `dataEncryptionKey` and `walletAddress`
- Entry into an account's off-chain metadata

Over the past months, it has become noticeable that especially the authorization of signer keys by the "account key" is a very useful method to authenticate the "account owner" without having to unnecessarily bring the "account key" online which is the most privileged, and thus most important to secure. Example of such cases have been:

- The signing of the off-chain metadata should ideally not happen with the account key. During the development of the `ReleaseGold` smart contract it has been found that smart contracts as accounts cannot sign metadata. As a workaround, verifying metadata has been adjusted to allow any authorized signer to sign the payload, which violates the intention behind having well scoped authorized signers in the first place.
- As part of PGPNP, accounts have to authenticate with the PGPNP service for rate-limiting purposes. To do that, the "account key" has to sign the request which also violates the intention of keeping keys that can move funds as cold as possible.
- For other applications such as Profile Picture/Names or more down-the-road applications such as messaging, specific encryption keys are going to be useful. Additionally, the `dataEncryptionKey` seems out of place, despite it being effectively also an authorized key (if not signer).

As applications are developed on Celo, it becomes evident that this mechanism of authorizing signers is useful beyond the PoS system and this CIP proposes standardization to facilitate this good practice.

## Goals

- Reduce the chance of fund loss on Celo
- Increase the ergonomics of key management on Celo

## Proposed Solution

Expand the `Signers` struct in `Accounts.sol` with a generic mapping and generic version of `authorizeXSigner`, `removeXSigner`, `getXSigner` and `signerToAccount` that take as additional input `string namespace`.

- Multiple account keys? (effectively making locked gold somewhat of a custody solution)
- Authorization key
- Makes key management easier by allowing tools implement once interface

Another solution would be to enable the usage of smart contracts as signers.

In the current implementation, it is not possible to authorize smart contract addresses as signers, since they do not have private keys and are unable to generate the proofs required. To address that limitation, a "smart contract signer authorization" method can be added to the `Accounts` contract with the following characteristics:

Note: Each signer role will have its own variant of the solution outlined below (e.g. `authorizeAttestationSignerContract`, `authorizeVoteSignerContract`, etc. - similar to the existing implementation).

- Restricts smart contracts that are authorizable as signers to those created by `msg.sender` (for now, to limit potential damage from unforeseen malicious behavior)
- Accepts two parameters:
    - `contract (address)`
    - `creationTxNonce (uint256)`
- Performs the following preliminary checks on `msg.sender` and `contract`*
    - `msg.sender` is a valid account
    - `contract` is not a valid account and has never been authorized as a signer
- Verifies that `msg.sender` is the smart contract’s creator:
    - RLP encodes an array containing the `msg.sender` and `creationTxNonce` and hashes the result using the `keccak256` function
    - Checks for equality between the hash and `contract`
        - If the two values are not equal, revert the transaction
- Assign `contract` to X role for `msg.sender` (see note above)

*This logic has already been implemented in the `authorize` method (lines [562-566](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/Accounts.sol#L562)) but is not accessible in our case (i.e. `authorize` requires signature parameters). One solution, to avoid code duplication, is to extract that chunk of code into a reusable method that can be shared by various signer authorization methods.

## Alternative Solutions

Alternately, applications could always derive their own authorization scheme/smart contracts. However, it would not benefit from the tooling that could be possible for facilitating key management.

Instead of extending the `Signers` struct, a completely different smart contract `AuthorizedSigners` could be created. Functionality would be practically duplicated, but separated from the critical PoS system while gaining the benefit from a standardized authorization scheme.

## Risks

Upgrading core smart contracts + RG contracts.
